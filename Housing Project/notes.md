#### Data Types Interview Questions
Practice answering common interview questions about general data concepts and data types.

#### Introduction
Hi! My name is %%%% . I’m so excited because today I’m interviewing candidates for the data scientist role on my team, which means that I get to hire someone to help me analyze all this data! I got my budget approved, went through all of the applications, did my phone screens, and now I’m down to just a few candidates.

Whoever I hire needs to be data-fluent. I’ve heard stories from my friends about hiring people who know all about the latest algorithms but just didn’t know the basics. That can really cost a lot of time and money, and I don’t want that to happen to me. So, I’m going to make sure my next hire is skilled in all stages of data science.

There are three types of tasks I want to be sure they can do:

Exploratory analysis
Diagnostic analyses
Data organization
I’m going to ask them a mix of conceptual and applied questions to be sure they know the concepts and that they’d be able to apply them to the real world.

I might integrate some of these basic concepts into the other questions I ask them, too, but the basics are so important for this role that I am going to ask directly.

I really hope they talk through their answers. It’s so much easier to understand how someone thinks about data when they vocalize their thought process and assumptions. If I could give them one piece of advice for our day together, it would be:

When in doubt, talk it out!

Directions
For each question below, fill in your response in the free-response box provided. After you submit your answer, you will see our sample response. There are a lot of correct answers. Your answer may look different from ours, so we will touch on a few key points you should cover.

Theoretical Questions
Hi! Welcome to your basic data types interview! We’re going to start off with a few conceptual questions about working with data.

A person with long orange hair and light brown skin is looking up at a graph with stars as data points. The larger stars are connected by lines, creating a line graph. There is a telescope in front of the person.

Tell me about a data analytics project* you worked on and the major steps you took to complete it.

(*Note that this could be a project you complete as part of this Skill Path.)

Submit Response
The purpose of this kind of question is to be sure that you have worked on a project and give you the opportunity to talk about something that you should be very familiar with. Your answer should contain all the following elements:

* A short summary of what the project was about, include the data source and the question.
* A description of any assumptions that you made and why.
* A brief summary of how you cleaned the data, explored it, and reshaped it to meet your needs.
* A description of how you analyzed it. Did you do hypothesis testing? A/B Testing?
* A brief summary of the results and how you interpreted them, including future questions or limitations.

#### Situational Questions
* There are a lot of companies and organizations out there and we all face different challenges. The best interviewees I’ve met with really knew my company. They did their research and gave some thought to the types of problems we face and the data we work with. Let’s go ahead and apply the general concepts to some business problems.

* An e-commerce site: We have been collecting data on user behavior including clicks, time to checkout, unique visits, etc. Yesterday we saw a 50% drop in checkouts. We didn’t receive any customer complaints though. Using just the site data, how would you start to diagnose the problem?

 * A rideshare startup: We have demographic data, car ownership, and insurance premium data from 2019-2021 for residents in the Detroit area. We want to expand our services there in 2022. With this in mind, what questions would you develop for this dataset and how would you begin to explore this data?

 * We just got access to new data sources, and one of them is time-bound! It looks to me like there’s some seasonality to it, but I’m not sure. I know a little bit about working with time, but not a lot. Looks like you also list familiarity with time series on your resume. Wonderful! Let’s talk about some simple time series analysis.

 * What is time series analysis, and what aspects would you keep in mind when working with time series?

 * Change a string into a timestamp in Python.

 * Toy company: We launched a new toy campaign this year and want to know if our marketing was successful. How would you account for seasonal variation to determine if our advertisements affected sales?

 * I only took a brief look at the new data we are pulling into our data lake, but I’m hoping you can help make some sense of it. I’m going to ask a few questions about how you’ve worked with text.
  
 *  What steps would you take to normalize text?

 * Large manufacturing company: We have a collection of employee generated incident reports. We would like to use these records to identify trends across departments. What would you do to process this data?
