# 📊 Estimation Interview Questions & Answers

This document contains thoughtful responses and strategies for solving estimation questions often encountered in data interviews. These questions test your ability to think analytically, estimate parameters, and structure your logic.

## 🚇 How many people can fit on a subway train in Tokyo?

**Approach**:
1. Estimate number of train cars: ~10 per train.
2. Estimate capacity per car: ~150 people (including standing).
3. Multiply: 10 cars × 150 people = **1,500 people per train**.

## 🍓 How many boxes of strawberries are for sale in Paris today?

**Approach**:
1. Estimate Paris population: ~2 million.
2. Assume ~1% buy strawberries today = 20,000 people.
3. Assume each buys ~1.5 boxes: 20,000 × 1.5 = **30,000 boxes**.

Alternate check (supply-side):
- ~1,000 grocery stores × ~30 boxes per store = **30,000 boxes**.

**Estimate**: ~**30,000–35,000 boxes**.

## 🚴 How many bicycles would you need to set up a rideshare program in Boston?

**Approach**:
1. Boston population: ~700,000.
2. Target users: ~10% = 70,000.
3. Assume 10% use daily = 7,000.
4. Assume 3 uses/day per bike = 7,000 / 3 = **~2,300 bikes**.

**Estimate**: **2,000–3,000 bikes**.

## 🔢 How would you estimate the value of π?

**Approach 1: Monte Carlo Simulation**  
1. Randomly scatter points in a square.
2. Count proportion that fall inside inscribed circle.
3. Use ratio to estimate π:
   \[
   \pi pprox 4 	imes rac{	ext{Points in circle}}{	ext{Total points}}
   \]

**Approach 2: Geometric Approximation**  
- Circumference/diameter via physical measurement (historical method).

## 🗽 How many tourists will see a billboard in Times Square in a typical year?

**Approach**:
1. Estimate daily foot traffic: ~350,000 visitors/day.
2. Assume 80% see a billboard = 280,000/day.
3. Multiply by days in year: 280,000 × 365 = **~102 million** views/year.

**Estimate**: **~100 million** views/year.

## ✅ Review & Key Takeaways

- Break down open-ended problems into **steps**.
- Use **reasonable assumptions** and adjust if data changes.
- Apply both **top-down** and **bottom-up** strategies.
- Think proportionally: e.g., percent of people doing something.
- Estimation ≠ perfection. Showcase **structure and logic**.

You're now equipped with solid estimation strategies. Go impress your interviewers!
