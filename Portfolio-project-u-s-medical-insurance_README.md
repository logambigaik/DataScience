Project Overview
For this project, you will be investigating a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its parameters will seem familiar if you have done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path.

However, you are now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

To Do
Scoping Your Project
Now that you have looked over your dataset, plan out what you want to analyze. What is it that you want to find out about this dataset? Based on the way information is organized, certain inspections may be easier to perform than others. As you map out the process, consider the scope of your analysis as well.

Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project
